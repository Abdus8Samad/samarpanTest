That was enough. She did ask, because, all the kids at school are watching it. No, she will not see it. Once something is seen/heard, it can't be taken back. This one is best left alone",

Teach your kids strong values and then it shouldn't be an issue while watching cause the child knows it is just a movie and they know right from wrong. If everyone jumped off a bridge would you do it too? This movie is great to start asking questions to your child has this stuff happened to you or someone you know? How would you of handled it differently? You ask your kid you know all the different ways you could handle these situations presented in this movie correctly, right? Kid answers no well then lets talk about this. Kids need to be comfortable talking about sex and drugs or seeing it on t.v. My mother sheltered me from these things, I got pregnant at 15 years old. So there ya go on what the results will be from sheltering your children. Who do you think I going to teach your kid about these issues? Seeing it in a movie make it more real and relatable.",

This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.",

He will carve out an empire for himself that will stretch beyond Birmingham. This with the aid of his family and his gang, the Peaky Blinders.",

In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond",

Friends has the special gift to transform fiction in situations who becomes so real than the viewer becomes part of the story. and this episode by episode. childish and smart, a film about the friendship and the refuse to grow up, seductive mixture of chaos, humor and thin tension, it is one of the pieces of the revolution of TV industry in the 90s. but the strange fact is the art to be more than proof of the spirit of a period. and this does it irresistible.",

It's a major stretch adding it to the other movie and I was not scared and very quickly I could care less what happened. A true dud! Wallis is nice to look at is the best compliment I can give! 06-28-2015",

            body: "What a great fucking description for this movie this site has. 'Before the Conjuring, there was ANNABELLE'. Gee, thanks guys! You know your film is lackluster when a LIFETIME ORIGINAL TV MOVIE is better than this. Yes, I thought Big Driver was a considerably better film. Perhaps considerably is a strong word, as I wouldn't call Big Driver a good film, but for what it was going for, and the audience it wanted to attain, it did a good job at giving the people what they wanted to see. This one, on the other hand, whoo boy, this was a rough movie to sit through. It gets two stars because the film is certainly watchable enough, Alfre Woodward is excellent here, and it has some decent scares. But this just seems to borrow heavily from other films like The Conjuring itself, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, Rosemary's Baby, among others. As you can see, the films that I've mentioned here all have one thing in common, and that is that they are all better than Annabelle. I don't think the film has one original bone in its body.",
