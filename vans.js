I read in some reviews people comparing it to Game Of Thrones but other than being it a medieval costume fantasy story there is nothing comparable to it. It's a totally different story, very entertaining if you are into that kind of stuff, which I am, with a lot of weird creatures, bizarre characters, and good battles. The two main characters are played by Henry Cavill and Anya Chalotra. Henry Cavill is perfect for that role, the rest of the cast are all contributing to a good new show, that will definitely have a lot of fans, a bit like GOT and probably the same fans. I can't wait to watch another season, hopefully the quality remains at the same level as the first season and then we're up for much more seasons, hopefully...",

I don't know the games nor the books but as a fantasy show The Witcher is solid but in no way a masterpiece like many claim: the action scenes are good but the dialogues (like some other reviewers state) are boring as hell, it is really difficult to follow all that blablabla, most times my mind just wanders away till some action is going on. The time jumping of the storytelling is also sometimes (especially at the beginning and if you don't know the books and games like me) really confusing. Anyway, the show grew with every episode on me and is in my opinion good if you are into very fantasy (some good action, good production), if not, don't bother.",

It is a dark fantasy, but the magic is consistent as is, for the first season, the storytelling. It's its own world and it's a good one. I never knew about the Witcher until I saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season. Not a bad performance and Yennefer and Geralt are the primary characters. Henry Cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done. There is one dragon, and it's nothing like the beasts from GOT. This dragon is more like a cousin of Smaug, and the more classical dragons. Well worth watching.",

What follows is a story were more people use the caves to travel in time; characters interact with people they know at different ages... sometimes they even interact with their older/younger selves. It is only a matter of time before they learn that a disaster is coming; will they be able to prevent it or will they be caught in a strange time-loop forever?",

It's a mystery crime, but a real good one. I don't know any of the German actors, don't know if they are famous in their country, but they sure can act. I thought they were all very good and all of them added something different to the story. A story that you have to watch very closely, without any disturbance and without losing your attention. Because if you do you won't be able to follow the story anymore. It's all a bit complicated and weird but in a good way. Certainly one of the better shows in this genre that I saw this year. The soundtrack is just excellent. It really adds something to the dark ambiance. I don't know if there will be a second season, it looks like it, but I'm certainly a fan and will for sure watch the next season if there is one. Class show!",

The trippy time-travel series received comparisons to Stranger Things when it premiered, but it's actually much deeper and more evocative of Twin Peaks.

There is just too much drama between all the characters. Drama isn't bad, but teenage drama is something else, it's something annoying to watch when past a certain age. The concept is about the same as the success series Dexter, following a sociopath that is convinced he's doing great things, and this with the narrating voice of the sociopath, in this case played by Penn Badgley, that narrates you everything he does and thinks. It worked better with Dexter than with You, but that's just something about quality. For the rest the story isn't that bad, but it could have been much better. I guess there will be a second season, one that I probably will watch in the hope it gets better, but I have my doubts about that.",

Well, people still are longing for feelings and recognition, where technology can be both of assistance and hindrance, but at times - as we see in this Series - even fatal. And contrary to what many people believe, smartphones are not for vanity fair only - even people who read books (so old-fashioned in the 21th century?) need them from time to time, to live a fancier life, not being stuck in inner space or in some imaginary world. The characters seem realistic, the performances more than average (some male ones even good, e.g. Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg, Luca Padovan as Paco), but as for the script, the drawing power began to fade for me, with some eyebrows-raising scenes when I really started to question the US police´s acting and failure to acting; come on, the events take place in a big city, not in a distant sparsely-populated area! A certain private detective did not add convincingness too much either. Well, I realize that I am not a member of the target group, so only 7 points from me. But you never know, I might even watch Season 2 when ready - as there is enough material for seguel.",

Characters development was rushed with unexpected deaths that did not leave any emotional impact to the characters you know from several seasons. I felt like the showrunners swayed far away from the first five seasons. First five seasons was great and kept you hooked. But this season dropped the ball. With a boring story. Boring directions that felt like a lot of time filler episodes. And one of the worst season finales.",

It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",

Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.",

This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times.

I like the Carnage as character, but I wish it was a tougher and gore movie. The relationship between Edin and Venom were like romantic comedy relationship. I don't like rap and I didn't like the main music of the movie. The after credits scene of the movie was shocking, I didn't expect it at all. Anyway, enjoy the movie, it's not a serious movie, but after the after credits scene, it made me very curious.",

Andy Serkis direction flowed perfectly with large budgeted carnage. Length is just right too has the right scenes needed nothing boring at all or otherwise. I'm impressed Tom Hardy voiced Venom, plays Eddie Brock, has a writing credit, and is a producer that's wild! Hope my thoughts are appreciated either way highly recommend this fun time experience.",

This had too much CGI and carnage, and not enough story to balance it. The entire 'bite' thing seemed like lazy writing and I'm sure a little more creativity would've gone a long way. Still a decent one-time watch. Hardy nails it as always. It's a 7/10 from me.... I Like Trains",

You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either.",

No, this is a perfect dose of escapism; intense, emotional and brimming with action. It picks up the best hanging threads from Casino Royale and Skyfall, throws in some callbacks to classic Bond movies and allows Craig to leave an immense mark on this franchise. I'm thankful that he didn't walk away after Spectre, and really delivered something to savor here. Given the runtime, this could've been a last gasp - but far from it. This is a joyride well worth taking.",

Her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of the entrance to an abandoned theme park. They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.",

Especially for her and what she gets into. Very creative and very well done. Not just for the little ones, but for adults as well. Commenting further on the story would not do it justice, the pictures speak for themselves. I can only recommend it so much, you have to know if it is for you - if it is, you have one hell of a journey ahead of you! Enjoy!",

Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads. They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park. Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house. As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls. Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku. He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits. However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.",

The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. Gotta catch my train, bye." ,
