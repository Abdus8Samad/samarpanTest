            body: "There is a theme about the value of human existence and the fight between our inner self to survive and the inner drive to be entertained. Besides “Bojack Horseman” and “Archer” (though the latter isn’t consistent), it’s one of the few cartoons that features very consistent continuity from one episode to the next, where characters grow and change. A thing that happens in a previous episode remains “having happened” and isn’t abandoned with the standard cartoon reset button (a la “South Park” or “Family Guy”). Moreover, as the show progresses, the individual characters experience profound, personal changes that you can see and appreciate. If all this heady philosophy bores you, don’t worry. The show has the best dialogue I’ve ever heard. It’s sharp and on point. It can be so subtle at times that I’m forced to pause an episode and rewatch a scene over and over to absorb what’s being said. Small details are built into scenes that you will gloss past until someone tells you about that tiny feature on a wall or an article of clothing worn by a character. It’s just that deep.",

            body:"While genres such as science fiction, humour and satire have always existed in television, no other show can take all three and wring, twist, and wrangle your brain dry quite like Rick And Morty. Centering around the intergalactic adventures of brilliant, psychopathic and alcoholic scientist Rick and his completely-out-of-his-depth, sidekick nephew Morty, the series by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon was breathtakingly ambitious in its first three seasons, where it took us through a mind-bending maze of parallel universes and timelines, with deeply meta narratives, self-aware characters and sentient plotlines. Having set the bar ridiculously sky high, and garnered a rabid and overly-critical fanbase, the show is now tasked with out-smarting itself - a hellish predicament you see the writers address directly several times (even as they rise to the challenge) in Season 4.",

            body:"Parents need to know that Rick and Morty is intended for mature viewers who can take the copious violence, alcohol consumption, and sexual content in stride. The show centers on a degenerate relationship between an anxious, socially marginal teen and his lunatic lush of a grandfather who drags him into absurd schemes through time and space. In other words, there are no positive role models here; in fact, the show's foundation is the sadistic emotional control Rick wields over Morty. Violence is graphic albeit in a cartoon way, so you'll see body explosions, gushing wounds, weapon use, and some death. Expect some sexually suggestive stuff as well, with hints at nudity (a girl flashes Morty, although only the top part of her breasts is visible) and some bawdy talk about sexuality.",

Sex is limited to some talk and exposed butts. Penis are there but pixelized. Rick drinks a lot but really...WHO CARES. And for swearing, have you EVER visited your childs' middle school??? The are swearing like crazy in there so as long as your child is in middle school, everything on thsi show is fine. Also, for all you overprotective parents out there, what do you think will happen if your child watches something voilent or sexy. NOTHING. They will be the exact same kid as before, but now are watching a great show.",

Several episodes contain violent scenes, characters are brutally exploded, impaled and there heads explode. They are also severely decapitated. There are a huge number of sex Jones, Morth often talks about how he will masturbate, characters are lusting over one another, teens are about to have sex, they suck each other’s nipples. Morty has violent sex with a sex robot. No sex is shown,but there are heavy implications of sex. The language and drinking is huge.",

Morty and his father, Jerry are very easily manipulated, and the relationship between Morty's parents is equally troublesome. The violence in the show, including but not limited to attempts of suicide, successful suicide, emotional abuse and shooting of dead bodies can also pose as a serious concern for parents. That being said, the show is still incredibly formatted with multi-faceted characters, all of whom genuinely care for each other, even if they do not always show it.

He finds himself strangely attached to her and becomes a police consultant. He has the power to draw out a person's inner desires. She's divorced from fellow detective Dan Espinoza (Kevin Alejandro) and single mom to Trixie. Psychiatrist Linda Martin (Rachael Harris) can't keep her hands off of him.

Until he falls in love with police detective Chloe and becomes her civilian consultant. Each episode brings a new case of murder that Chloe and Lucifer solve by combining her detective and his supernatural abilities, with Chloe not knowing that he really is the Devil. The murder cases are quite original, the ways they are solved are cleverly designed and interesting, and the mutual relations of the characters are entertainingly complex and imbued with great humor. Over time, the series introduces more and more new characters and celestial beings, but it succeeds in maintaining the level of development of characters and their interrelations, and not getting lost in exaggeration and excessive complicating. The characters are diverse, well developed and there's one for everyone's taste. Personally, I prefer Mazikeen, the main torturer in Hell and Lucifer's bodyguard, although they somewhat spoiled her in the third season.",

Lots of stiff contrived grinning by our Luc; sort of a forced smile. That is the extent of the acting for this series. 3. Why w/wings as his only apparent once heavenly attribute do we never see him flying? Would be too weird I guess. And, why our they made of bird feathers - couldn't God find a more powerfully innovative way to get his angels to move about? Speaking of angels it seems there are lots & lots of different religious interpretations of who Lucifer really is in the scheme of things. Not clear in this script! 4. Still sticking w/wings how is it that they can grow/emerge out of his scapulas and through his clothing so effortlessly, and when they retract the clothing is untouched? 5. Lots of lacking attention to detail such as the episode in which a dog walks through blood leaving dog paw prints, but prints look stamped - not smeared as they normally would be. 6. With all the things to investigate on Earth he is spending a lot of time on street level crime. Is this like a punishment? And, always the usual murder/crime scenes found in most every crime series/film. Yawn! 7. The acting reminds me of plastic; can't tell if this series is suppose to be a comedic interpretation of our fallen angel. Oh well, Netflix is up to the task of selling time consuming cheap thrills.",

Although it highlights some elements from the Bible, it's fictional but very thought provoking. If anything, it brings you closer to your beliefs as a Christian so Christians should not be put off by the title. My biggest take away from this series is unconditional love, the love that the two main characters had for one another and the love that existed between all the principal characters. They couldn't have chosen better actors for each role, every actor was perfect for their character. The whole series was highly entertaining, very funny and romantic with minimal nudity and love scenes. Your mind and heart moves with the characters in every episode. Cleverly and brilliantly written, I couldn't recommend it enough.  Although I have completed the whole series, I still go back to some scenes that I can't get out of my mind. My favourite scene of the whole series is Chloe and Lucifer playing the piano in season 1. There was zero physical contact between them but it was the most romantic scene for me. Needless to say that I have seen that scene well, a few times. Well done to the entire team for putting such a memorable show together, I'm so glad I watched it!",

And has helped out the police on the toughest cases. Life was going smooth with Shinichi. On one night however, he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Where 2 men in black clothes were about to get their cover blown by Shinichi. One of them knocked him out cold and forced a poison pill that was meant to end his life. However instead of killing him. It made him shrink from a teen to a kid.",

And as he tries to find a way to get back, he still continue to solve murders with the help of Edogawa, and his friend Ran and her lousy detective father. The kid still has got all the knowledge and skill he's got from his older self, but he can manage. And his gadgets are cool, he can alter his voice, mostly making it that detective Mouri guy, with whom he makes the hero of every story and episode, for shame! But still you know it's him and he doesn't seem to complain that Detective Mouri gets all the credit, or that he's still a kid. This is one of the best anime shows I've seen, and I still love it. Recommended for all anime fans and to non-anime fans who dig murder or mystery or crime stories, this for you.",

The series revolves around a teenage detective whiz who is shrunken down to the size of a child by an experimental poison. He must then masquerade as an eight year old (going to school, etc.) while keeping his identity a secret and a look out for the villains that gave him the poison. Helping him is a funny inventor who gives Conan (an alias the character uses as a child) cool James Bond like gadgets, like a bow tie with a voice distorter and shoes that magnify kicking strength.",

Because is really hard to find translated piece of the manga, people who only speaks English are missing out on this masterpiece. I highly Recommend reading the manga first, I watched the show as a kid so it is really special to me, but looking back, the animation of the early episode was really a product of the 90s, the anime also have a lot of tv original episodes that acts as a filler, they are generally not very good. I hope somebody could translate the manga in English so everyone can see just how good this is.",

            body:"Broadcasting in he U.S. as Case Closed, Detective Conan is an interesting mystery/comedy/thriller that looks like a kiddie show but definitely ia much more to the series. Plot: a teenage detective protoge is turned into a kid by a weird poison and must help solve cases for his girlfriend's bumbling father under a alias until he can find the people who did this to him and recover an antidote. The premise, like I said, sounds kiddie but as the series rolls on things start to get messy and at times, a bit disturbing, but the cases are so ingenously planned out and executed you can't help but watch just to see how Jimmy/Conan will get the jobs done with such a small guise working against him. The animation is pretty good, bright and colorful though dated (eight years old now) but has its own style of anime. The dub isn't bad either, once again Funimation ,the folks doing the recording down here, have hired some excellent voice talent that matches each characters personalty very well though some tend to overact (the junior agency for example). Overall a great series that blends comedy and mystery very well. The only gripe being its very long (over 100 episodes) but still fun to watch. Give it a watch if you need a break from all the action animes or just a fan of Japanese cartoons in general. As Jimmy/Conan always say: With a keen eye for detail, one truth prevails.",

            body: "Right from its opening scene, in which a man is murdered by a ghost, Cinderella sticks close to the horror movie formula. A character (here, it is Raai Laxmi as Akira, a sound designer) is arrested as a suspect, but she claims she is innocent. She has come to a hill station to record the sounds of a few rare birds for a Hollywood project. She finds a Cinderella costume in an antique shop and brings it home and has paranormal experiences. Meanwhile, Ramya (Sakshi Aggarwal), a rich girl is killed and her mother becomes the next target of a ghost. Who is the ghost and why is it on a killing spree? If it had been released some 10 years ago, Cinderella might have come across as mildly engaging. But given that we have had 789 horror films and horror comedies over the past decade, the film hardly comes across as a fresh attempt. There is a flashback that slightly plays around with the Cinderella story... a maid who is harassed by her employers discovering the angel within her after buying a costly gown. A rich, young man (read a prince) falling for her. Raai Laxmi's earnest performance in these portions somewhat carry the film, but Cinderella is otherwise filled with predictable plotting. Even the scares are mainly jump scares that we can anticipate much before they happen. This flashback segment is the strong point of the film, but we also get a tasteless comedy scene featuring Robo Shankar who tries to make us find lines like Priyanka Chopra.. Daily en kooda dhaan saapdraa. His comic lines in this guest appearance are crass and cringe-worthy and only reinforce the notion that it is time our comedians realise that even verbal innuendos are sexual abuse.",

Sure, political correctness , minorities rights, new generations . But the classic fairy tale is used as pretext for a film incapable to convince than must exist. The good things are not insignificant, from the laugh front a fist of scenes to the good job of Minnie Driver , the dress and necklece of Godmother, perfect for the actress interpreting queen Tatiana to some song. But the terms awfull or too easy were not so rare. Sure, I am very subjective , but I think, the meaning of a Disney film is not to be reduced at shock audience but to propose fair, new, smart to wise perspectives about familiar texts.",

Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers. The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling. Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right.",

Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in Mamma Mia (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it's nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I'd not be so harsh - but I'm not and this is poor, really poor...",

The setting and idea, grab your attention at the outset. Saif Ali Khan speaking an unknown village dialect with an anglicised accent, in that unique Saif voice is unintentionally funny. His knack of going for unheroic characters, off the beaten track is admirable. But intent and attempt can be amusing to a point. His performance leaves you conflicted here. He comes across as an odd mix of trying too hard to be funny and not trying at all to be invested in his character. Arjun and Yami are sincere, the only actors to have understood the assignment. Jacqueline and Saif seem more like tourists in Dharamshala, who chose to act in this film as a pastime.",

Not only do the brothers Chiraunji and Vibhooti drive around in a Mystery Machine-esque van, they soon form a sort-of ‘gang’ with sisters Maya and Kanika (Yami Gautam and Jacqueline Fernandez). There is even a ‘pardafash’ moment midway through, but I won't get into that. The mismatched duo – Vibhooti is a rapscallion and Chiraunji is the sort of person who'd have carried the burden of family expectations in his youth – are in the ‘tantric' business. Fortunately for them, they were born in a society whose very survival hinges on superstitions. Business, therefore, is booming.",

But its over-reliance on genre cliches – exAll my friends were talking about La Casa De Papel (I really don't get why you have to call it Money Heist) as it was the best series ever so I was really curious and excited to watch it. I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on.pect everything from projectile vomit and wall-crawling ghouls to a creepy kid and a haunted forest – stops it from ever being more than a middling film that aims to please the masses.

Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts. 'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the 'appreciated' directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as 'a colossal military disaster'.",

If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle.",

I have a bit of hesitation with the portrayal of some of the soldiers. The Cillian Murphy character is perfectly fine as a soldier suffering PTSD. If he's the only one, it would be a very compelling portrayal but Nolan puts in too many. I'm also willing to accept Tommy's lies to escape. It's not until the beached boat where there seems to be a problem. I can understand the Lord of the Flies mentality. With Germans taking potshots at them, there are two logical moves. They could either go out and fight or hide and wait. They have guns and fighting is possible. There is no logical reason to kick out Frenchie which would only prove their existence in the boat. They are acting irrationally which is excusable but Tommy needs to call it out. I would also want a separate section with soldiers fighting rear guard action. Tommy's tale could be so different and more action packed if he stayed to fight for a little while. Overall, Nolan's film-making skills are undeniable and this is a compelling exploration of this historical event. ",

I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no 'Tora Tora Tora' or 'The Longest Day' which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.",

            body: "This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this. As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in 'Titanic'--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from 'Third Rock' suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.",

            body:"I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say. My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.",

            body:"The 'kiss' platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has pretty much ruined movies to a point as it's rare when one can walk into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know, storywise, as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me, there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.",

This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.",

My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in 'The Avengers'. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",

True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters. Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory. And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.",

Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together. Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.",

I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.",

I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me. There are lots of movies that use 'movie geography' that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It's using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.",

            body: "None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls. In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system. He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.",

            body:"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story – the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the 'best film of all time' on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact. Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.",

            body:"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman). Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth. If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",

Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget. The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity. I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",

            body:"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",
